/* public/js/arcade-games.js — WHAT IS IN THE ARCADE. One file, five sites.
 *
 * "This needs to be one code base of Brayton's games, hosted on Godot, that
 * can then be at /arcade on all of our sites."
 *
 * SO THE ARCADE IS THREE FILES AND A FOLDER, and nothing else:
 *
 *     public/arcade.html          the cabinet wall   (identical everywhere)
 *     public/js/arcade-games.js   THIS FILE          (identical everywhere)
 *     public/js/arcade-play.js    the player         (identical everywhere)
 *     public/arcade/<id>/         one game's build   (identical everywhere)
 *
 * Copy those to Nicotia, Herbal-Leaf, Kawaii Katz or Stompbox and the arcade
 * is there. The only thing that differs between the sites is the palette, and
 * every one of them already loads its own tokens.css -- so the page reaches
 * for --bg, --leaf, --gold and --line and comes out wearing the local colours
 * with no per-site branch. Same argument as api/markets.js and api/shelves.js:
 * a behaviour every site shares is not a behaviour a site file gets to own.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A GAME IS NEVER LOADED UNTIL SOMEBODY PRESSES IT, and that is a hard rule
 * rather than a nicety. A Godot web export is 10-25MB of WASM. Auto-loading
 * one on a page that also sells things would cost the shelf its mobile load
 * time, which is the one thing on this site that actually makes money. So the
 * wall renders covers, and `embed` is fetched on click, in an iframe.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE COOP/COEP TRAP, WRITTEN DOWN BEFORE IT COSTS AN EVENING.
 *
 * Godot 4 exports with THREADS require two response headers:
 *
 *     Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
 *     Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
 *
 * COEP blocks every cross-origin subresource that does not opt in. Set it on a
 * page of this site and EVERY PRODUCT PHOTO GOES BLANK -- Shopify's CDN,
 * lookah.com, vapor.com, all of them. It is the single most destructive header
 * that could be added to this repo.
 *
 * TWO WAYS OUT, and this file takes both:
 *   1. Prefer a SINGLE-THREADED Godot export (`threads:false` at export time).
 *      It needs no headers at all, so it can be served from anywhere. Slower,
 *      and for a 2D game nobody will notice.
 *   2. Where a game genuinely needs threads, the headers go on THAT GAME'S
 *      PATH ONLY, via a scoped `headers` entry in vercel.json matching
 *      `/arcade/<id>/(.*)`, and the game is played in an iframe so the parent
 *      page never inherits them. `threads:true` below is what says so, and
 *      arcade.html refuses to inline such a game into the page.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * PERMISSION. The two games this was built for are Brayton's (Dean), and the
 * owner said plainly that they do not have his full sign-off yet. So the page
 * is noindex, is in no nav and is in no sitemap, and every entry here starts
 * `listed:false` -- present, playable by someone with the link, advertised to
 * nobody. Flipping `listed` is how a game goes public, and that flag is the
 * one thing that should wait on Brayton actually saying yes.

  /* Each entry:
   *   id       folder under public/arcade/, and the ?g= value

   *   blurb    one line, what it is
   *   cover    a still. Local, or omitted for a drawn placeholder.
   *   embed    the page to iframe. Omitted = not installed yet.
   *   threads  true only if the build needs SharedArrayBuffer (see above)
   *   weight   rough download, printed BEFORE anyone commits to it
   *   listed   false keeps it off the public wall
   *   controls what to press, shown under the open cabinet. The wall
   *            never prints these; a player who has not loaded the game
   *            has nothing to press yet.
